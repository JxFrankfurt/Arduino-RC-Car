# Arduino-RC-Car
This is code for a Bluetooth RC car run with two Arduinos and stepper motors.
This code was written as part of a team project. The two other members(Brandon Grant and Jephtha Eernisse) focused primarily
on the 3-D printed parts needed, while I focused primarily on the code.
I used a library written by Mr. Koblich, and recieved help sending multiple pieces of data
over bluetooth from Chandler Griscom and Evan Boone.
